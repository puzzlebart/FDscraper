He then, at Quimby's request, supplied Quimby with his bribe, a bag full of money, with Quimby being ecstatic as \"the dollar signs don't lie,\" something Maggie Simpson, who was crawling through the ventilation at Marge's behest as her \"secret weapon\", briefly witnessed.

When he heard that the family would be going to Europe for one of Rita's tours, Abraham realized that Homer is defenseless and wouldn't survive in Europe, so he stayed behind with him while Rita went to Europe, and the two never saw each other again."},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/1/1c/NorbertVanHoutenTSTO.png/revision/latest?cb=20170524053956","Name":"Norbert Van Houten","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/b/be/Snake_Jailbird.png/revision/latest?cb=20131223201428","Name":"Snake Jailbird","Bio":"A former student of Middlebury College, Snake referred to himself as \"Professor Jailbird\"; it was also revealed that he was formerly an idealistic Indiana Jones-type archaeologist, until Moe stole the Mayan gold coins that Snake had discovered and was going to donate to the museum, so he decided to take his revenge out on society (convenience stores).[1] Snake also has a son named Jeremy."},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/a/ab/Bert.png/revision/latest?cb=20170705062823","Name":"Brt Sampsan","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/9/96/Creepy_dad.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20111108142059","Name":"Old Dad","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/6/6d/Candy_Store_owner.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20111109021603","Name":"Bill Dandy","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/8/8c/Patches.png/revision/latest?cb=20130721183102","Name":"Patches","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/9/97/Ballet_Teacher.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20100818190132","Name":"Ballet Teacher","Bio":""},{"Picture":"","Name":"Yuri Nator","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/0/0c/Artie_Ziff.png/revision/latest?cb=20150727093911","Name":"Artie Ziff","Bio":"Artie was a student at Springfield High School.

Upon first glance, one might mistake him for a child with dementia, or, perhaps, they might even look at him as mentally challenged. What is definite, however, is that he can't help it, as evidenced by his apparently slow grasp of things in the world around him, his difficulty in studying, and his sporadic speech impediments. It is shown in Moms I'd Like to Forget that he was a normal, well functioning baby, until he was dropped on his head by his father. His unique manner of speech is often the source of the character's trademark random quotes, where Ralph may make a comment such as \"What's a battle?\", \"It tastes like... burning!\", or \"Mr. Flanders, you're blindeded!,\" as well as his tendency to call his teacher \"School Mommy\" and on one occasion calling Superintendent Chalmers \"Super Nintendo Chalmers.\" He appears to have several talents. He is an incredible tap dancer and played the role of George Washington in the school play. As Washington, he not only recited his lines perfectly but also managed to play the role so well that he brought the audience to tears.[1] In Season 2 (or Season 3), he seems not to be having speech impediments, and learning disabilities. Ralph is in his first year of second grade and also shown to be able to drive his father's police cruiser."},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/4/42/200px-Yves_Bouvier.png/revision/latest?cb=20111114203543","Name":"Yves Bouvier","Bio":""},{"Picture":"","Name":"Unnamed boy with red glasses","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/0/0c/CANDACE.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20150802164325","Name":"Candace","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/c/c3/Hanuman.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20160722200958","Name":"Hanuman","Bio":"Later in the episode, The Simpsons were watching the sunset by the rebuilt church.

Nicky became convinced that Marge is self-righteous to the point of judgement and supported Homer by comforting him. When Marge arrives to talk to Homer about the events she caused, Nicky firmly accuses her of \"choosing her self-righteousness over her family's happiness\" before going on to give Homer a cheque of $1,000,000 out of respect and sympathy. Homer is appreciated by Nicky's generosity and, despite Marge's protests, takes the money home after getting a lift back from Nicky, who tells Homer to appear to him should he want it; promising him

Upon first glance, one might mistake him for a child with dementia, or, perhaps, they might even look at him as mentally challenged. What is definite, however, is that he can't help it, as evidenced by his apparently slow grasp of things in the world around him, his difficulty in studying, and his sporadic speech impediments. It is shown in Moms I'd Like to Forget that he was a normal, well functioning baby, until he was dropped on his head by his father. His unique manner of speech is often the source of the character's trademark random quotes, where Ralph may make a comment such as \"What's a battle?\", \"It tastes like... burning!\", or \"Mr. Flanders, you're blindeded!,\" as well as his tendency to call his teacher \"School Mommy\" and on one occasion calling Superintendent Chalmers \"Super Nintendo Chalmers.\" He appears to have several talents. He is an incredible tap dancer and played the role of George Washington in the school play. As Washington, he not only recited his lines perfectly but also managed to play the role so well that he brought the audience to tears.[1] In Season 2 (or Season 3), he seems not to be having speech impediments, and learning disabilities. Ralph is in his first year of second grade and also shown to be able to drive his father's police cruiser."},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/6/63/Sarah_Silverman_%28character%29_.png/revision/latest?cb=20150608235726","Name":"Sarah Silverman","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/1/18/Larry_Davis_Experience.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20080322225152","Name":"The Larry Davis Experience","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/3/37/Tony_Hawk.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20100423201931","Name":"Tony Hawk (character)","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/2/25/Geech.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20081021220351","Name":"Geech","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/0/0d/Screen_Shot_2017-04-16_at_9.22.00_PM.png/revision/latest?cb=20170417022221","Name":"Mall Cop","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/9/9d/Comic_Book_Guy.png/revision/latest?cb=20140825023038","Name":"Comic Book Guy","Bio":"Comic Book Guy is an obese and socially incompetent man who is perhaps best known for his sarcastic quips.

However, he then saw that Marge was upset with him for spending time fishing instead of with her, especially because they were attending a marriage counseling retreat at the time."},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/3/3c/Sauna.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20171025052019","Name":"Sauna User 2 (couch gag)","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/1/12/Man_in_military_uniform.png/revision/latest?cb=20130308213248","Name":"Man in military uniform","Bio":""},{"Picture":"","Name":"Zoira","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/a/a2/Nedmond_Flanders.png/revision/latest?cb=20130602075824","Name":"Nedmond Flanders","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/3/3c/Kenny.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/349?cb=20130711191700","Name":"Kenny","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/2/25/RussCargillTSTO.png/revision/latest?cb=20170524054335","Name":"Russ Cargill","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/6/6c/DeathTSTO.png/revision/latest?cb=20170904013710","Name":"Grim Reaper","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/7/72/106.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20120626092329","Name":"Wendy Wordsworth","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/4/47/El_Puerco%27s_second_girlfriend.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/272?cb=20130604154359","Name":"El Puerco's second girlfriend","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/6/68/Oscar.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20121218102645","Name":"Oscar the Grouch","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/3/39/Jean-Claude_Charles.png/revision/latest?cb=20171203184455","Name":"Jean-Claude Charles","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/3/35/ThatBatchWasFauxPas.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20150512220714","Name":"Pete Spuckler","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/7/7b/4D696D9E-A5CB-46E3-BF22-F1A71040331C.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20180227020908","Name":"Zolar The Adulterer","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/9/9e/BTB.png/revision/latest?cb=20170705150145","Name":"Bart The Boy","Bio":""},{"Picture":"","Name":"Dash (PBS Kids)","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/6/6b/Hazel-0.png/revision/latest?cb=20181216224557","Name":"Hazel Bazaar","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/e/ec/Female_Twin.PNG/revision/latest?cb=20110808013123","Name":"Female Twin","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/0/0a/Robert_Terwilliger_Tapped_Out.png/revision/latest?cb=20171118020924","Name":"Robert Terwilliger","Bio":"Robert Terwilliger (aka Sideshow Bob) began his career as \"Sideshow Bob\", a non-speaking sidekick on Krusty the Clown's television show. In actuality, his younger brother, Cecil, had auditioned for the role, which Krusty was not impressed by and saw Bob as the ideal comic foil who would be ridiculous and never stand him up.[7] Sideshow Bob endured much as was to be expected from clown sidekicks, such as being targeted with pies and shot out of cannons, but Krusty took on a more sadistic bent in order to get laughs, which had been shown to be a habit of doing to other sidekicks of his. Sideshow Bob soon began to tire of these antics, and also realized that off-camera Krusty was engaging in vulgar behavior such as illegal gambling and patronizing strip joints. Fed up with enduring abuse in order to make money to fund Krusty's carnal appetites, Sideshow Bob began plotting Krusty's downfall.[8]"},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/a/a1/Italian_Pete.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20130622132629","Name":"Italian

When his parents were lost at sea and presumed deceased, the kids at the school were impressed by Milhouse's stoicism, even Nelson, who refrains from beating him up. Bart brought Milhouse's uncle Norbert (who is of Danish descent and resides in Solvang, California) to Springfield to console Milhouse.[12] When Milhouse's mother moved with him to Capital City after his parents separated, in another episode, he dyed his hair blond, wore fashionable clothes and acted rude to impress his new friends, who acted similarly. He even asked Bart to let him give him a wedgie to impress the others. After his father Kirk won custody of Milhouse and brought him back to Springfield, everything went back to normal.[13]"},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/b/b6/Jenny_%28Official_Image%29.PNG/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/247?cb=20130116031220","Name":"Jenny","Bio":"Comparisons"},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/9/99/Stingy%26battery.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20100119170244","Name":"Battery","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/0/0f/Microsoft-Edge-Web-Notes-c6824e9033285468.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/291?cb=20180212042009","Name":"Heather Spuckler","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/0/02/Fat_lady.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20121218035056","Name":"Carmen Opera Singer","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/b/b6/Queen_Elizabeth_II_2.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20130510203433","Name":"Queen Elizabeth II","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/8/84/Blazed_and_Confused_23.JPG/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20141117213141","Name":"Jack Lassen","Bio":""},{"Picture":"","Name":"Barney Fife","Bio":""},{"Picture":"","Name":"The Blob","Bio":""},{"Picture":"","Name":"P75","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/f/ff/Gvfghg.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130904152842","Name":"Alfreda LeDoux","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/4/45/ScreamFace.png/revision/latest?cb=20141130021153","Name":"Ghostface","Bio":""},{"Picture":"","Name":"Wal-E-Weasel","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/7/7f/Scrat.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20100829211244","Name":"Scrat","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/e/e5/Late_Show.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20111223052315","Name":"David Letterman","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/c/c0/Ali_Rudy_Val%C3%A9e.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20130708203200","Name":"Ali Rudy Vallée","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/8/8e/Nerd_%28SU%29.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20111219134242","Name":"Nerd (SU)","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/f/f1/Repair_man.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20130220122734","Name":"Repair man","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/5/52/Kid_sour_puss.png/revision/latest?cb=20150611170801","Name":"Kid Sourpuss","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/0/09/Otto_Mann.png/revision/latest?cb=20130930205930","Name":"Otto Mann","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/e/e9/The_Raving_Derilict.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/345?cb=20100501163357","Name":"The Raving Derelict","Bio":""},{"Picture":"","Name":"Pharell Williams","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/1/1c/NorbertVanHoutenTSTO.png/revision/latest?cb=20170524053956","Name":"Norbert Van Houten","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/2/2c/Jer.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20100928190458","Name":"Jer","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/5/5f/188.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20180126233151","Name":"Barry White (character)","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/1/14/Teleport_worker.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20111218161250","Name":"Heathrow Teleport Departures Worker","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/9/91/Boom.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20070613185507","Name":"Jack Bauer","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/9/9a/Whiteb.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20081107220553","Name":"Carnage Destructicus","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/5/59/Wolfguy_Jack.png/revision/latest?cb=20100715204939","Name":"Wolfguy Jack","Bio":""},{"Picture":"","Name":"Ellen (Agnes Skinner's Mother)","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/c/cd/P225_158_211.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130402110151","Name":"Fifi Bouvier","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/2/20/Calabrese_Family.png/revision/latest?cb=20071106192331","Name":"The Calabresi","Bio":"They later are shown attending a sit-down with Fat Tony and his mafia.

His mood abruptly swings, and he seemingly-arbitrarily plays favorites: while constantly having little to no tolerance for Principal Skinner's well-intentioned mistakes, he shows apathy and dismissiveness of Ned Flanders' absolute non-disciplinarianism during his brief tenure as principal. It appears his only reason for constant hostility towards Principal Skinner is that Skinner \"really bugs him\". Whenever he visits Springfield Elementary, some sort of disaster strikes. He produces extreme anxiety in Principal Skinner, who offers increasingly improbable stories to explain what is happening. Chalmers is known for throwing the doors to the rooms open and bellowing \"SKINNERRRRR!!!\" or \"SEYMOUR!!!\", to which Seymour stammers, \"S-Superintendent Chalmers!\" His catchphrase has caused some paranoia in Skinner.[6] Also, he has seven principals otherwise than Skinner, but he has never yelled thier names, not even once.[7] On a few occasions, he says Skinner's name (or in one case, words pronounced similarly to \"Skinner\" such as \"Skimmers\"[8]) this way when absolutely nothing has gone wrong, implying that he either pronounces Skinner's name this way by habit, or does it on purpose to scare him. Chalmers has shown a caring side towards Skinner, when he called out for Skinner and when he had a reply that Skinner was okay, he told Skinner to \"Never do that again\" (scare him).[9] Similarly, he had at least some grudging respect for Skinner, as he personally organized the surprise 20th anniversary celebration of Skinner's time as principal of Springfield Elementary and even made an unscheduled and secret visit to the school specifically to make the announcement before Skinner arrived at the Teacher's Lounge (although he did express annoyance at Skinner's meticulous inspections throughout the school due to being forced to duck behind a corner and hide every time Skinner did an inspection before passing by the teacher's lounge, notably saying in response to the constant inspections \"Good lord! The rod up that man's butt must have a rod up its butt.\" after barely arriving at the Teacher's Lounge undetected by Skinner).[10] He also worked with Skinner during the disastrous Edutainment event at Springfield Elementary School, where he and Skinner portrayed Bud Abbot and Lou Costello's respective roles in their famous \"Who's on First\" comedy routine (although Chalmers eventually snapped at Skinner and walked offstage swinging his bat while bitterly referring to him as a \"sexless freak\" under his breath after the latter unintentionally spoiled the routine in the first six seconds by explicitly stating the word play of the pronoun and the actual subject, a person with that surname.).[11]"},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/6/67/Tapped_Out_Unlock_DrHibbert.png/revision/latest?cb=20141120144510","Name":"Julius

He initially created the various Sims series, but apparently he was bankrupted after he created a flop called Sim Sandwich, after this, he took over the Bargain Bin level. His role in the Bargain Bin level is to destroy the old and long-forgotten games that people don't play anymore. He threatens to destroy old Simpsons games from the 8-bit era, thus killing old versions of the Simpsons themselves. Bart and Homer are chosen to save their old selves and defeat Will Wright alone. When the Game Engine was destroyed, he escaped to heaven with Matt Groening.

Chester then became a bum for many years until he and Bart Simpson opened up a case against Itchy & Scratchy Studios for 800 million dollars. Chester and Bart won the case, making Chester incredibly wealthy. With his earnings, he bought a solid gold house and a rocket car. The payout to Chester from the studio lead to its downfall, so Bart and Lisa went to Chester to ask him to fund Itchy & Scratchy Studios. When Lisa tried to convince him to do so by telling him he'd get royalties, Chester replied, \"I don't need any more money. I'm not greedy. As long as I've got my health, my millions of dollars, my gold house, and my rocket car, I don't need anything else.\" Lisa then says, \"Yes, but...\" and is then interrupted by Chester saying, \"Not

As much as Hoover is concerned for the future of the children (as opposed to Edna, who doesn't seem to care the slightest), she hates her job and seems overwhelmed with stress, seeking whatever remedies she can to alleviate it. Hoover is often seen smoking even while teaching, even under a \"No Smoking\" sign in the assembly hall. She also occasionally drinks on the job.

career went downhill due to his reported unusual paraphilia, which apparently involved fish, to the point where he had not worked in twelve years. To cover this up, he began a relationship with Selma Bouvier, whom he had met when she gave him an eye test at the Department of Motor Vehicles. This revived his career, leading him to star in Stop the Planet of the Apes, I Want to Get Off!, a musical version of the film Planet of the Apes. To further revive his career, McClure's agent suggested that he marry Selma, a proposal which she accepted. At his bachelor party, a drunken McClure told Homer Simpson that the marriage is just a sham to help his career. At the wedding, an unknowing Selma married Troy. Selma discovered that their marriage was a sham and although she accepted it, she drew the line when McClure's agent suggested that the pair have a child. As \"all the big parts these days are going to family men\" having a child would have secured McClure's casting as McBain's sidekick in \"McBain IV: Fatal Discharge\". Having rejected his offer, Selma left McClure. As a result McClure starred in his own independent film \"The Contrabulous Fabtraption of Professor Horatio Hufnagel\".[5]"},{"Picture":"","Name":"JJ Gruff","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/5/56/Hospital_administrator.png/revision/latest?cb=20130119133910","Name":"Hospital administrator (future)","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/d/df/Screen_Shot_2017-04-16_at_9.13.55_PM.png/revision/latest?cb=20170417021413","Name":"Fat Christian","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/4/42/200px-Yves_Bouvier.png/revision/latest?cb=20111114203543","Name":"Yves Bouvier","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/9/9e/252px-HerbPowell.png/revision/latest?cb=20130419075612","Name":"Herbert Powell","Bio":"He briefly settled in the Simpson household, despite his intense continuing antipathy toward Homer.

He proceeded to mass-produce his new product and regained his fortune. He then proceeded to pay back the Simpson family the $2,000 but also bought Homer a vibrating chair, Marge a new washer and dryer set, Bart a life membership in the National Rifle Association, Lisa a monthly set of classic novels, and a promise that he will buy something nice for Maggie.

Simpson became fast friends after Ruth moved in next door. One evening, they went to a ballet after Homer, who was originally supposed to go with Marge, literally got stuck at work (with his arms in two vending machines). Later they had a girls' night out where they went line dancing at a country bar called Shotkickers, went raving at an underground club named The Hate Box, did some target shooting (using a farmer's antique cans as targets), and went up to the Springfield sign overlooking the city. They ended up going on the run from the law, however, after Chief Wiggum tried to pull them over because of a broken taillight, and Ruth chose to flee because they were driving the car which she had stolen from her ex-husband.[1] One possibility for she not getting any punishment from stealing the car is that her ex-husband didn't give any money even though the court demanded it. Finally, the auto theft charges against Ruth were dismissed, undoubtedly due to the fact that Lionel Hutz was representing her ex-husband."},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/2/2b/Sarah_Wiggum.png/revision/latest?cb=20180818001544","Name":"Sarah Wiggum","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/7/77/Blazing_Guy_attendee_%285%29.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/233?cb=20141119145623","Name":"Blazing Guy Member 4","Bio":""},{"Picture":"","Name":"Larry Burns' wife","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/9/96/Babe.png/revision/latest?cb=20160825164940","Name":"Babe the Blue Ox","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/0/07/Frosty_the_Snowman.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20180218000935","Name":"Frosty the Snowman","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/d/df/Chris_Griffin.png/revision/latest?cb=20170101193900","Name":"Chris Griffin","Bio":"In the episode The Simpsons Guy, Chris had to leave Quahog with the rest of his family to get away from a bunch of angry feminists who were mad at his father's comics. At the beginning of the episode, he made a fourth-wall joke, watching a crossover between All in the Family and Modern Family, listing off a bunch of negative things that crossovers usually do, such as being driven by marketing. When he went to Springfield, he lived in the Simpson house and became friends with Maggie Simpson. Chris was seen sitting next to Maggie at the dinner table and watching her suck her pacifier. He yanked the pacifier out and used it himself, making her cry and take it back. When she took it back, Chris started crying, but then Maggie took another one of her pacifiers and gave it to him, and they both enjoyed pacifier sucking together. Chris was later seen with Brian, while he was walking Santa's Little Helper. When Santa's Little Helper got loose, Chris and Brian had to start chasing after him, but had no luck and lost him.

His role in the Bargain Bin level is to destroy the old and long-forgotten games that people don't play anymore. He threatens to destroy old Simpsons games from the 8-bit era, thus killing old versions of the Simpsons themselves. Bart and Homer are chosen to save their old selves and defeat Will Wright alone. When the Game Engine was destroyed, he escaped to heaven with Matt Groening.

After her expulsion, she briefly dated Bart Simpson. According to Bart's experiences with her, Jessica encouraged his negative behavior and eventually pushed him down an extremely steep hill littered with truck accidents on his skateboard. Later, Jessica went as far as to activate the fire alarm at Springfield Elementary during the school day as a prank, causing a mass panic at the school. It is stated (by Bart) that she has an IQ of 108, and that \"she's like a Milk Dud; sweet on the outside, poison on the inside.\" She inevitably went too far, however, by stealing the collection money from the First Church of Springfield (where her father is minister) and blaming it on Bart.

One evening, they went to a ballet after Homer, who was originally supposed to go with Marge, literally got stuck at work (with his arms in two vending machines). Later they had a girls' night out where they went line dancing at a country bar called Shotkickers, went raving at an underground club named The Hate Box, did some target shooting (using a farmer's antique cans as targets), and went up to the Springfield sign overlooking the city. They ended up going on the run from the law, however, after Chief Wiggum tried to pull them over because of a broken taillight, and Ruth chose to flee because they were driving the car which she had stolen from her ex-husband.[1] One possibility for she not getting any punishment from stealing the car is that her ex-husband didn't give any money even though the court demanded it. Finally, the auto theft charges against Ruth were dismissed, undoubtedly due to the fact that Lionel Hutz was representing her ex-husband."},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/d/d5/Timothy_Lovejoy_Sr.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20171107120137","Name":"Timothy Lovejoy,

Lisa also deeply values her integrity, sometimes at the expense of others' needs and happiness, as demonstrated when she cheats on a test in The Wind in the Willows to attain her highest grade of A plus, but later admits her dishonesty to an unreceptive Principal Skinner despite the fact that such a grade allowed the school to gain the extra income it 'desperately' needs. (She later regrades the test as an F.[8]) Also, Lisa was willing to tell everyone about Bart faking his kidnapping attempt to go to a concert, despite the fact that absolutely everybody involved in the case was better off just because she could. Despite her intellect, Lisa has received detention, like her brother Bart, quite a number of times, often because of her rebellious and sometimes bitter attitude and antisocial behavior that is capable of deeply embarrassing authority figures. Although her rebellion against social norms is usually constructive, Lisa can be crazy, cruel, and rebellious at times. When she believes herself to be right she won't admit that others could be as well, and will often force her beliefs onto people. Notably, her increasing sense of moral righteousness regarding her vegetarianism leads her to proselytize, culminating in her spiteful disruption of a \"meat-based\" barbecue prepared by Homer (an act she comes to rue).[9] At times, Lisa appears to resist certain situations merely for the sake of resisting them, not because of any genuine ideological opposition. She appears to enjoy breaking the norm for its own sake; in one time, she triumphantly declares that she, a girl, would like to join the football team. When it is revealed that there are already girls on the team, she declares her distaste for a sport that would use a pig's skin to make its ball. When it is revealed that the ball is actually synthetic and the proceeds of buying it go in part to charity, she is at a loss for words and runs off visibly upset.[10] She also seems to dislike having her intellect challenged, which is evident on occasions such as when she was temporarily promoted to the third grade or when Miss Hoover gave her a B+ on her final grade for conduct and actually caused her physical harm because of it. Lisa's first word was Bart at two years of age. Despite her high IQ, cuteness and beauty, Lisa does have typical childhood issues, sometimes requiring adult intervention. She once tricked Homer into allowing her to ride the bus alone, only to become hopelessly lost. After his coworkers Lenny and Carl point out that he allowed his daughter to ride a bus by herself, Homer comes to her rescue.[11] Lisa has a Jewish imaginary friend named Rachel Cohen who \"just got into Brandeis University.\" Even with a high intellect, Lisa displays personality traits typical for her age, including obsessing over getting a pony, being addicted to TV, and fighting with Bart. Lisa once got addicted to secondhand smoke to maintain an impressive level of ballet competence; Homer tries to prevent the addiction unsuccessfully, and in the end Lisa overcomes the addiction herself through means of \"Hello Kitty\" nicotine patches.[12] She also displays a surprising amount of skill in driving, especially for her age, sometimes even taking the wheel whenever Homer ended up distracted from driving.[13] In \"The Girl Who Slept Too Little\", she struggled with nightmares after a cemetery was moved next to the Simpsons' house. She overcame her fear after spending a night in the cemetery and realized that it was acceptable to suffer from fear despite her intelligence. It was revealed in this episode that Lisa largely had to raise herself due to Homer and Marge dealing with Bart's antics thus ensuring a lack of nurturing for her. Lisa has been known in earlier seasons to have a bit of a sassy attitude. Like Bart and most siblings in families, Lisa has been known to tease Bart herself, examples such as; crushes Bart has developed, or advice on writing to someone (in this one case, his teacher), even just plain sassing him for attention. Deep down inside, Lisa loves her brother deeply."},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/2/2f/Godfrey_jones.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20100824092534","Name":"Godfrey Jones","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/d/d5/Lem.JPG/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/324?cb=20151227044744","Name":"Lem","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/c/c7/Firemen.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20111225060826","Name":"Fireman 2 (couch gag)","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/1/1d/Classy_pig.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20170101194709","Name":"Classy Pig","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/d/df/Patrolman_1.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20130313172246","Name":"Patrolman 1","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/a/a3/MrGammel.png/revision/latest?cb=20170418221800","Name":"Mr. Gammel","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/5/50/Yodeling_Zeke.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20150717234715","Name":"Yodeling Zeke","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/6/67/Maggiebobobear.gif/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20100717192644","Name":"Bobo","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/f/f2/P185_166_221.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130330113747","Name":"Colette Merlot","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/8/8b/Trucker_5.png/revision/latest?cb=20130308223940","Name":"Trucker 5","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/0/0f/Kaiser_Wilhelm_II.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20131218111210","Name":"Kaiser Wilhelm II","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/2/2f/Mr._sakamoto.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20100921222335","Name":"Mr. Sakamoto","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/1/18/Emily_Winthrop.png/revision/latest?cb=20130723075633","Name":"Emily Winthrop","Bio":"She is the \"Systematic Self-Esteem Squasher\" type of mom you meet at the PTA.[2]"},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/9/96/Tobias.jpeg/revision/latest?cb=20180211221358","Name":"Tobias Drundridge","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/1/10/Barking_Dog.png/revision/latest?cb=20130105155227","Name":"Barking Dog","Bio":""},{"Picture":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/6/68/Barney_Gumble_-_shading.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/265?cb=20180313200146","Name":"Barney Gumble","Bio":"As a teenager, Barney had great potential.

For example, when forced to quit drinking while training to be an astronaut, he almost immediately regained his diction and balance and proved to be an exceptional astronaut candidate.
